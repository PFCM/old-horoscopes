# Old horoscopes

This is a web app which shows you some old horoscopes.

Or at least, it will be.

Mostly, it is an experiment.

The web app part uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and the docker image for deployment is based on [this excellent image](https://hub.docker.com/r/p0bailey/docker-flask/).

Tests are run with [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). To run:
